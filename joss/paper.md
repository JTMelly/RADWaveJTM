# Summary

Satellite radar altimetry is an excellent remote sensing technique that can be used to determine significant wave height and wind speed [@Chelton:2001]. These measurements can be used to calculate wave height, period and power [@Young:2018].

Since the first launch of the *GEOSAT* altimeter in 1985, there has been almost continuous data collection, with only a small gap between 1989-1992 due to no operating satellites. Consequently, analysis of this long-term temporal record provides new insights in inter-annual, seasonal and decadal variation in wave statistics.

Additionally, the high spatial resolution provided by altimeter data is particularly well-suited for remote regions, or locations where no long-term measurements exist [@Ribal:2019]. An extensive global database of all altimeter missions spanning from 1985-present is available on the Australian Ocean Data Network and has been compiled, calibrated and validated by [@Ribal:2019]. However, for many users, this dataset can be difficult to analyse and only provides significant wave height and wind speed.

# RADWave

**RADWave** is Python package that provides a mechanism to access altimeter datasets through web-enabled data services (THREDDS). The package capabilities are illustrated in Figure 1 based on the the Australian Ocean Data Network global database [@Ribal:2019]. **RADWave** allows  the user to query over a range of spatial and temporal scales altimeter parameters in specific geographical regions and subsequently calculates significant wave heights, periods, group velocities, average wave energy densities and wave energy fluxes.

While domain experts are able to assess satellite radar altimetry datasets, they currently have to download the data manually and write custom analysis and visualization functions using, e.g., numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to extract wave characteristics. **RADWave** combines this all into a simple object-oriented framework.

**RADWave** can be used to easily calculate past wave conditions and infers long term wave climate variability, providing new insights on wave modal conditions, seasonal changes, long-term trends and associated modulation by climate oscillations. It can also be used to assess locally the impact of wave-generated cyclones in offshore areas.

Along with the documentation a series of Jupyter Notebooks are presented to illustrate the package capability. **RADWave** enhances the ease of access and analysis of altimeter data and is designed for researchers and industry focusing on offshore wave conditions globally. To the authors' knowledge, no open-source code currently exists that provides such capability.

**RADWave** is currently being applied to the characterisation of wave climate and extreme events offshore the Great Barrier Reef and to determine the magnitude and resulting impacts of extreme wave events offshore One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef.
