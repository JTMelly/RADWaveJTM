    "description": "<p>RADWave is Python package that provides a mechanism to access altimeter datasets through web-enabled data services (THREDDS). The package capabilities are illustrated based on the the Australian Ocean Data Network (AODN database that spans from 1985-present and that has already been calibrated and validated by [Ribal and Young, 2019].</p>\n<p>RADWave allows to query over a range of spatial and temporal scales altimeter parameters in specific geographical regions and subsequently calculates significant wave heights, periods, group velocities, average wave energy densities and wave energy fluxes.</p>",
